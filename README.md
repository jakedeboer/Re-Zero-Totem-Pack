# Re:Zero Totem Resource pack for Minecraft



This is a resource pack for Minecraft that changes the sound effect of the Totem of Undying to the iconic **Re:Zero death sound**. Currently, it supports **Minecraft 1.21.4**, but I may add additional version support in the future.
## Features

- **Custom sound for the Totem of Undying**: The sound is replaced with the iconic death sound from **Re:Zero**.




## Installation

    1. Download the resource pack ZIP file.
    2. Open Minecraft and navigate to Options > Resource Packs.
    3. Click Open Resource Pack Folder.
    4. Move the downloaded ZIP file into the resource pack folder.
    5. Enable the resource pack in the Resource Packs menu.
